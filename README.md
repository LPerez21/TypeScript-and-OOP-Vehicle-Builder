# Vehicle Builder

## Description

The Vehicle Builder is a TypeScript-based command-line application that lets users create and interact with different types of vehicles. Building on an existing codebase, this project adds **Truck** and **Motorbike** classes alongside the original **Car** class. Users can:

- **Create** a new vehicle (Car, Truck, or Motorbike) by entering its specific details  
- **Select** from a list of previously created vehicles  
- **Perform** vehicle-specific actions (e.g., drive, stop, turn, load/unload cargo, pop a wheelie) in a loop until they choose to exit  

All user interaction is handled via the [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package.
